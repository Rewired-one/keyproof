Enterprise Signing Portal

There is a popular community saying: “EOS will run the world!” - this is something we connect with, and are working to facilitate daily.
 
One of EOS’s unique talents is that EOSIO is a fantastic Private and Public chain. We need to grow the EOSIO enterprise blockchain market share within large blue chip companies. The demand for enterprise blockchain technology is growing rapidly. We need to compete well in this area!
 
We can create ecosystem growth, by giving more opportunity for real world business to use EOSIO and integrate with the EOS mainnet. Starting with tamper evident hashing and leading into other private / public chain interoperability and use cases.
 
One of our challenges to growing the EOSIO market share in enterprise blockchain adoption has been the lack of ability to sign transactions using their existing identity and security infrastructure. Keyproof aims to cross that bridge, and showcase the power of EOSIO in solving real world business problems.
